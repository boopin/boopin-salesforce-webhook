# Boopin Salesforce Webhook

This lightweight Flask API receives lead data from TikTok and Snapchat via webhooks, and forwards it to Salesforce CRM in real-time.

## ðŸ”§ How it works

- TikTok/Snapchat POST leads to `/webhook` endpoint
- The data is authenticated and immediately pushed to Salesforce using OAuth2
- All logic is handled securely server-side
